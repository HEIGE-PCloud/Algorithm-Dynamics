\section{Milestone 6: Handle API calls}

By following the instructions of the Microsoft Graph API documentation\cite{microsoft:docs:education-overview}, I login the Graph Explorer\cite{microsoft:graph-explorer} and run a \code{GET} query over the \code{/education/schools} endpoint. However, I received a 400 bad request.

\begin{minted}{json}

    "error": {
        "code": "Request_UnsupportedQuery",
        "message": "Property 'extension_fe2174665583431c953114ff7268b7b3_Education_ObjectType' does not exist as a declared property or extension property.",

        }
    }
}

After some investigation, I must have an admin account of an education organization in order to call these education APIs.

I then tried my school account, which belongs to an education organization.

But unfortunately, my student account is not an admin, and therefore has no permission to call these APIs as well.

Consider that it is impossible for me to register as an education organization, and it is impossible for me to ask for an admin account from my school, the integration with Microsoft Teams for Education is not possible to implement.

Even if I can use these API, the Judging security issue which I mentioned before still applies. Therefore I decide not implement this part of the project. All of my stakeholders express that they understand this limitation and they agree with my decision.
